Kinda Like Snake But Not Actually Snake. A terminal-based game using Curses.

The game is still a work in progress. Here is a list of some things that I want to get done:

- Make a default map for the game (with walls that lose you the game if you run into them)
- Revoke the ability for the Snake to move on top of itself
- Add some form of map parsing (thinking about .PGM file parsing)
- Interesting map mechanics i.e. buttons that open/close hidden doors or portals, maybe other ideas
- Fix some of the issues with running the game. For example, the executable seems to not work if you don't open it from console

It is also based off of Curses so it is NOT Windows compatibility. Adding Windows compatibility will be considered later.
